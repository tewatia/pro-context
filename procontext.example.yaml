registry:
  metadata_url: "https://procontext.github.io/registry_metadata.json"
  # How often to check for registry updates in HTTP mode (stdio checks once at startup).
  # Lower values keep library metadata fresher; higher values reduce outbound traffic.
  poll_interval_hours: 24

cache:
  # How long fetched content is considered fresh before triggering a background re-fetch.
  # Applies to both llms.txt files (get_library_docs) and documentation pages (read_page).
  ttl_hours: 24
  # db_path default is platform-specific (via platformdirs) and independent of data_dir:

  #   Windows: C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\procontext\cache.db

  # How often the background cleanup task removes entries expired more than 7 days ago.
  cleanup_interval_hours: 6

fetcher:
  # Timeout (in seconds) for each HTTP request to a documentation source.
  # Increase if you regularly fetch large pages or are on a slow network.
  # Applies to every fetch made by get_library_docs and read_page.
  request_timeout_seconds: 30

  # Block requests to private/internal IP ranges (10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, 127.x.x.x,
  # ::1, fc00::/7, etc.). Strongly recommended to keep enabled — disabling this allows
  # ProContext to reach internal network services, which may expose sensitive endpoints.
  ssrf_private_ip_check: true

  # Restrict fetching to a known set of trusted domains. When enabled, ProContext only
  # fetches URLs whose base domain appears in the allowed set (built from the registry,
  # extra_allowed_domains, and any dynamically discovered domains per allowlist_depth).
  # Set to false to allow fetching from any domain — only appropriate in fully isolated
  # or air-gapped environments where all reachable hosts are trusted.
  ssrf_domain_check: true

  # Controls how far beyond the registry the domain allowlist is expanded at runtime.
  # Has no effect when ssrf_domain_check is false.
  #
  #   0 — Registry only (default, strictest)
  #         Only domains explicitly listed in the ProContext registry are trusted
  #         (extracted from docs_url and llms_txt_url of each registry entry).
  #         Use this if you want tight control over what ProContext can reach.
  #
  #   1 — Registry + URLs listed inside llms.txt
  #         After fetching a library's llms.txt, any URLs found in that file have
  #         their base domains added to the allowlist. Useful when a library's docs
  #         span multiple domains not all covered by the registry entry.
  #
  #   2 — Registry + llms.txt URLs + URLs inside fetched pages
  #         Additionally, any URLs found within documentation pages fetched via
  #         read_page are also trusted. Allows following cross-references to domains
  #         not in the registry. Note: in long-running HTTP mode the allowlist grows
  #         as more pages are read and resets only when the registry is updated.
  allowlist_depth: 0

  # Additional domains to always trust, regardless of allowlist_depth. These are merged
  # with the registry-derived allowlist at startup and persist across registry updates.
  #
  # ProContext matches on base domain (last two DNS labels), so adding a shared hosting
  # platform like "readthedocs.io" or "github.io" will trust ALL projects hosted there,
  # not just a specific one. Add shared hosting domains only if you trust the platform
  # broadly.
  extra_allowed_domains:
    - github.com           # GitHub repository pages and documentation
    - githubusercontent.com # Raw GitHub file content (raw.githubusercontent.com)
